# IrisDiscreteInfoAnalysis
 a tools to compute p.m.f after discretizing the dataset, calculate discrete entropy for its features, and determine discrete mutual information between feature pairs


Project

• Compute the probability mass function of the features of the Iris dataset
after having discretized the samples as integers.

• Compute the entropy of the features of the Iris dataset (discrete entropy).

• Compute the mutual information between any pair of features of the
Iris dataset (discrete mutual information).
